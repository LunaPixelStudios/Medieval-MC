#Define dependency overrides below
#Dependency overrides can be used to forcibly remove a dependency constraint from a mod or to force a mod to load AFTER another mod
#Using dependency overrides can cause issues. Use at your own risk.
#Example dependency override for the mod with the id 'targetMod': dependency constraints (incompatibility clauses or restrictive version ranges) against mod 'dep1' are removed, and the mod will now load after the mod 'dep2'
