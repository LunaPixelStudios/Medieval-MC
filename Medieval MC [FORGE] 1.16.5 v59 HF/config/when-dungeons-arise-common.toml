#Basic configuration options
#	    'Spacing' and 'Separation' values are useful if you want to tweak
#	    the amount of structures that generate.
#	    Keep in mind that spacing has to be higher than separation.
#	    I.e.: shirazPalaceSpacing = 1, shirazPalaceSeparation = 0 will generate the 'Shiraz Palace' on every possible chunk.
#	    'SpawnpointSeparation', on the other hand, is used to prevent structures from generating near x = 0, z = 0.
#	    Further customization options are available through datapacks. This includes structure layout, loot and mobs."
